# zed2nvidia3d
Display realtime video collected by zed camera on NVIDIA 3D device.  

This is Yongzhen's graduate design at TYUT. Write at 2019.5. Upload at 2020.12.
Language    : C++
IDE         : Visual Studio 2017 community.
Libary      : OpenCV 3.4.5, ZED SDK 2.8, NVAPI
Referance   : OpenCV_Samples

* `4.RunLocal` to run program on your local host, make sure your PC have connected with 3D VISION and ZED.
* `5.*` is an LAN version, `NetSend` should executed at host which connected with ZED camera, and `NetReceive` should executed at host which connected with NVIDIA 3D VISION.
* `StereoUnproject` is NVIDIA's 3D VISION demo project, you can get some 3D VISION's profile at here.
* Because I have graduated from TYUT, so I don't have a ZED with me. So I can't add new feature or gave advanced technical support. If you find some program has issue and can't solve it, you can contact me.
